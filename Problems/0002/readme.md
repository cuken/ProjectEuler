# Problem #2

## Even Fibonacci Numbers

```
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
```

## Thought Process

We'll create a recurssive fibonacci function to call in the helpers package. This will allow us to call
for the next number in the sequence until we hit our maximum. 400000 should be underneath the int range
so we won't need to do anything crazy with the int limit.
