## Lattice paths

```
Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.
<div style="text-align:center;">
<img src="project/images/p015.png" class="dark_img" alt=""/></div>
How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?

```

### Thought Process

Dynamic programming baby!!
