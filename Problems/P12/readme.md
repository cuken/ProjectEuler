## Highly divisible triangular number

```
The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7<sup>th</sup> triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:
<p style="text-align:center;">1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:
<blockquote style="font-family:&#39;courier new&#39;;"><b> 1</b>: 1<br/><b> 3</b>: 1,3<br/><b> 6</b>: 1,2,3,6<br/><b>10</b>: 1,2,5,10<br/><b>15</b>: 1,3,5,15<br/><b>21</b>: 1,3,7,21<br/><b>28</b>: 1,2,4,7,14,28</blockquote>
We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.
What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?

```

### Thought Process

We need a method that will show us the trangle numbers sum.
We need a method that will take that sum and list all divisors.
We need to itterate through until the divisors found is 500.
