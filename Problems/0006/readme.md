## Sum square difference

```
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
$$1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385$$
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
$$(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025$$
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is $3025 - 385 = 2640$.
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
```

### Thought Process

We need to first find the sum of all intergers from 1 to 100 squaring each one and adding it to a total.
We then need to add all intergers 1 to 100, then square that sum, getting a total.
Finally we'll take the second and first total and find the difference between them.
