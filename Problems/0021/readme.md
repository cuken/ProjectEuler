## Amicable numbers

```
Let d(<i>n</i>) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of <i>n</i> (numbers less than <i>n</i> which divide evenly into <i>n</i>).<br/>
If d(<i>a</i>) = <i>b</i> and d(<i>b</i>) = <i>a</i>, where <i>a</i> â‰  <i>b</i>, then <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are an amicable pair and each of <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are called amicable numbers.
For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.
Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.
```

### Thought Process

We could easily brute force this.
We can iterate through all 10000 numbers and see if they are amicable, if they are add it to the sum and return the sum at the end.
