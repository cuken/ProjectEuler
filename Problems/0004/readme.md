# Problem 4

## Largest palindrome product

```
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
```

## Thought Process

We need to find the product (multiplacation) of two three digit numbers and identify if it's a palindrome. 

The first easiest check is to see if the front number and the back number match, if they do, then we can continue to check.

If the product has an odd number of digits, we only need to check the outer bands, if it has an even number, all numbers must match.

We can save time by starting from the largest number and working our way backwards;
